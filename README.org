Some of the modes that have icons instead of names now:

| Modes      | icon                                                                     |

* Requirements

  As of version 0.3.0 you can also use icons from some icon fonts,
  specifically:

  - [[http://fontawesome.io/][Font Awesome]]
  - [[https://octicons.github.com/][GitHub Octicons]]
  - [[http://fizzed.com/oss/font-mfizz][Font Mfizz]]
  - [[https://icomoon.io/#icons-icomoon][IcoMoon]]

  The icons look the best if you have the fonts installed on your
  system and mode-icons will not do this for you.

* Installation
** Manually

   Place ~mode-icons.el~ somewhere in your =load-path= and copy the
   ~icons/~ directory there as well. Then =require= ~mode-icons~ in your
   [[http://gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] init file.

* Usage
  Once installed you can add =(mode-icons-mode)= to your init file.
** Ignoring mode-icons in other buffers
When looking at buffers with commands like ~ibuffer~, they display the
icons for the mode names as well. If you don't like this behavior you
can change ~mode-icons-change-mode-name~ to be nil:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mode-icons-change-mode-name nil)
#+END_SRC
 
** Changing how mode-icons recolors images
Additionally, if the image icon was an ~xpm~ icon, then you can have
it changed to match your mode-line face.  In the example below, the
inactive mode-line shows the emacs and yasnippet icon changed to match
the inactive mode-line:

This also will match whatever color-theme you have installed.  For
example, if you use the popular cyberpunk theme, you would see the
icons colored to match the color-theme

This is enabled by default, and can be disabled by:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mode-icons-desaturate-inactive nil)
#+END_SRC

You can also change the icon to match the active mode line (disabled by default):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mode-icons-desaturate-active t)
#+END_SRC

Some of the black and white images are tagged as black and white and
are automatically recolored to match the mode-line face.  You can turn this off
and use the black and white image by setting:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mode-icons-grayscale-transform nil)
#+END_SRC
** Creating xpm images from fonts
To create/recreate all the xpm images for the font images, you can
run =M-x mode-icons--convert-all-font-icons-to-xpm=.

This requires a working =gimp= installation, and all the fonts for the
icons installed.  This will start an inferior scheme process for
=gimp= in =*mode-icons-gimp*= and convert all the images to xpm files.

After the images are created, you can stop the =gimp= process by
typing:

=M-x mode-icons--stop-gimp-inferior=

This should be stopped evetually if there is no input received to gimp.
